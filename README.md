**⚙️ How to Use / Customize**  
1. Create a repository named exactly as your GitHub username (e.g. `Mdarafatchowdhury`).  
2. Add a `README.md` file (this content).  
3. Replace the placeholder text, links, and icons with your own.  
4. Update your skills, projects, and stats link.  

Let me know if you want me to build a version fully customized for *your* actual skills & projects (with real icons) — I can generate that for you!
